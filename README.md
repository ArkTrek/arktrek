# 🚀 My Machine Learning and AI Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here you'll find a collection of my projects spanning various fields of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. From face recognition to vehicle detection, each project is designed to solve real-world problems using cutting-edge technology. 🌟

## 📚 Projects

### 1. 🟢 WhatsApp Bomb Message Detection and Prevention
- This project mainly uses Node.js to create a WhatsApp API and provides a QR code-based WhatsApp Web login system in the terminal. After logging in, the system provides the live feed of WhatsApp messages based on the written code and tracks spam messages sent by someone. A message gets classified as spam if the message contains certain keywords or repetitive phrases. It then detects that and blocks the user using the WhatsApp Web ID assigned to every user in its network.

### 2. 👤 Face Recognition
- It uses ML and simply detects the faces found in a camera frame using OpenCV. It's a very simple project and almost anyone can build it themselves from scratch.

### 3. 😊 Emotion Detection Using ML
- This project mainly uses the face detection project then uses a Haar cascade classifier as data to train and label different emotions given by the user. It is successfully able to provide emotions like "Happy", "Sad", "Angry", etc., and uses OpenCV for all the video processing.

### 4. 🚗 Vehicle Detection Using ML
- This project basically uses pretrained models to detect vehicles and classifies the same as moving objects. Based on the extracted features, we are able to determine the type of vehicle it is as well. But as similar to the face detection one, this also is a very simple project to build from scratch.

### 5. ✍️ Handwriting Based Paper Evaluation System
- This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to recognize handwritten text from images, enabling the digital conversion of handwritten notes.

### 6. 👁️ Eye Disease Detection
- It uses fundus images as input and based on the patterns trained using them, we can predict the disease happening in the eye. This method uses ML as well and is used to automatically contact doctors if based on the detected eye disease. This works based on the corresponding program alone.

### 7. 🧠 Alzheimer's Detection
- Uses Magnetic Resonance Images(MRI scans) as input and predicts the type of brain disease the person has and based on that the amount of precautions and necessary treatments the person has to take will be conveyed accordingly.

### 8. 🐾 Animal Intrusion Detection
- A system in which a camera is focused at an area. Based on this areas range, whenever a certain animal is seen in the camera, it shows which type of animal it is and based on this detection using speakers gives certain noises as output to make them go away. This uses IoT and ML.

### 9. ✋ Gesture Recognition
- The gesture recognition system uses a MediaPipe library within Python and uses OpenCV to utilize video processing accordingly. It uses CSV labeling method for training datasets using OpenCV as input. It then uses Google Colab for training and based on that generates a model file that can be used to detect live gestures. Number of gestures detected = 10. Gestures are "Hi", "Close", "Pointer", "Love", "Done", "No", "Awesome", "Longlive", "Peace", "Hello".

### 10. 🍃 Leaf Disease Detection
- This gives the type of disease a leaf has and prints it using OpenCV accordingly. It mainly focuses only on apple, blueberry, cherry, corn, grape, orange, peach, bell pepper, potato, tomato.

### 11. 🎭 Theyyam Detection
- This predicts four types of theyyams. Namely "Muthappan", "Vishnumoorthi", "Gulikkan", "Bhagavathi" after taking an image as input.

### 12. ⚔️ Violence Detection
- Takes in a video as input and generates an output video that shows if the video contents contain violent or non-violent content in it or not.

### 13. 🌿 Weed Detection
- Finds weeds in a live camera feed and based on the feed detects weeds of different types and based on the detection using a system shoots lasers at them when needed.

### 14. 🔬 Resistor Detection and Value Interpreter
- This detects the type of electronic component present in a camera frame. Namely detects capacitors, LEDs, resistors, transistors, and if the detected component is a resistor, it predicts the measure of resistance based on the color bands by detecting contour lines of the color bands and determining the colors using HSV using Python. Then calculating the resistance value accordingly. The accuracy of the value is not 90%.

### 15. 🗺️ MapperIO - Google Map Alternative
- This uses ArcGIS API for creating a webpage that hosts map data and provides much more improved responses in comparison to Google Maps. It is also able to provide at the most of 8 basemaps and is able to provide a navigation system for the same as well. The code for this is not available here as it was built on a different system.

## ⚠️ Note
- The full code for all these projects is not uploaded here due to security risks and potential misuse by users with bad purposes. Additionally, the code for each project is not complete and may contain bugs.
